# Data Centralization and Analysis for Global Sales

## Project Description

- **What it does**: This project brings together all the different sales information of a large company from around the world into one place. Instead of having sales data spread out in many areas, we put it all in one easy-to-access spot. This makes it simpler to look at and understand the sales information.
- **Aim of the project**: The primary objective is to create a unified and reliable source of sales data, enhancing data-driven decision-making capabilities within the company.
- **What you learned**: Through this project, I was able to test and expand my knowledge on data extraction, cleaning, and database management. I was able to extract data from various different data sources and gained proficiency in cleaning through these differing datasets.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install necessary libraries: `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `numpy` (add any other required libraries).
3. Clone the repository/download the project files to your local machine.

## Usage Instructions

To use the system:
1. Run `data_extraction.py` to extract data from various sources.
2. Execute `data_cleaning.py` to clean and preprocess the data.
3. Use `database_utils.py` to load the cleaned data into the database.
4. Query the database as needed for up-to-date sales metrics.

## File Structure

- `data_cleaning.py`: Cleans and preprocesses the raw data for database insertion.
- `database_utils.py`: Handles the operations related to database management, including data insertion and querying.
- `data_extraction.py`: Extracts data from multiple sources, preparing it for cleaning and database integration.
